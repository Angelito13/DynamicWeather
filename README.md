Hello!

This is a Dynamic Weather Application. The purpose of this project was to gain in depth knowledge of SwiftUI and all the things it has to offer. The app is made with mock data as this was purely for educational purposes.
Next steps would be to implement a weather API to make the project fully functioning!

Thanks for checking it out
